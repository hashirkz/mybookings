# unfinished components  

## Signup.js 
will be very similar to Login.js  

## Nav.js  
main navbar header for all the signed in pages  

## History.js  
history page which contains signed in users booking history  

## Booking.js  
booking page which allows signed in users to create new bookings  

## SendRequest.js  
request page which allows signed in users to send a meeting request to users email?  
unsure about this page honestly the description on the pdf is awful and unclear.
